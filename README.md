## 🧠 How the Game Works

- Cards are stored in an array with duplicate symbols
- Cards are shuffled randomly
- Clicking a card flips it using CSS animation
- Two flipped cards are compared:
  - ✅ If matched → they stay flipped
  - ❌ If not matched → they flip back
- Game continues until all pairs are matched
